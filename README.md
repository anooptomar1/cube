cube
==============

cube is an iOS game developed in Swift and SceneKit. It marks the first Swift or SceneKit development I've done and the first computer game I will have written (since my Casio FX-7700 graphic calculator)!

The final form of the game is unknown at present and likely to change over time as I try out different ideas. At present it's looking like it might end up as a procedural, sandbox, tower defence game (although it won't look like that for a while yet) and it'll hopefully bring something a little different to that genre.

This repository will contain my journey of learning these languages and libraries, but it's not intended to be just a toy project. If I'm happy with the final result I fully intend to release this to the masses.
